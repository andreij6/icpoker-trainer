# Task 2.1 Implementation Summary: Hand Strength Evaluation for AI

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive hand strength evaluation functions for AI decision-making in the poker trainer application. The implementation includes both preflop hand tier classification and post-flop hand strength evaluation.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. `/utils/aiUtils.ts` (NEW)
- **`getHandTier(card1: Card, card2: Card): HandTier`**
  - Evaluates preflop starting hands
  - Returns: 'strong', 'playable', or 'weak'
  - Accounts for:
    - Pocket pairs (TT+ = strong, 99-22 = playable)
    - Suited hands (AKs, AQs, AJs, KQs, KJs = strong; Axs, suited connectors = playable)
    - Offsuit hands (AKo = strong; Broadway cards = playable)

- **`evaluatePostFlopStrength(holeCards: [Card, Card], communityCards: Card[]): PostFlopStrength`**
  - Evaluates hand strength after the flop
  - Returns: 'monster', 'strong', 'medium', 'weak', or 'trash'
  - Considers:
    - Made hands (using pokersolver library)
    - Pair strength (top pair vs middle pair, kicker quality)
    - Drawing potential (flush draws, straight draws)
    - Overcards and high card potential

### 2. `/tests/aiUtils.test.ts` (NEW)
- 48 comprehensive test cases
- Covers 33+ different hand combinations
- Test categories:
  - **Preflop:** Strong hands (11 tests), Playable hands (14 tests), Weak hands (8 tests)
  - **Post-flop:** Monster hands (3 tests), Strong hands (3 tests), Medium hands (3 tests), Weak hands (3 tests), Trash hands (1 test), Edge cases (2 tests)

### 3. Dependencies
- **pokersolver** - Installed for accurate hand evaluation
  - Ranking system: 1=High Card, 2=Pair, 3=Two Pair, 4=Three of a Kind, 5=Straight, 6=Flush, 7=Full House, 8=Four of a Kind, 9=Straight Flush
  - Higher rank = better hand

### 4. Other Files Modified
- `/specs/tasks.md` - Marked Task 2.1 as complete
- `/tests/deck.test.ts` - Added vitest-environment node comment (bonus fix)
- `/tests/handEvaluator.test.ts` - Added vitest-environment node comment (bonus fix)

## Success Criteria Met ✅

- ✅ `getHandTier(card1, card2)` returns 'strong', 'playable', or 'weak'
- ✅ Premium pairs (AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT) are identified as strong
- ✅ Suited big cards (AKs, AQs, AJs, KQs, KJs) are identified as strong
- ✅ Medium pairs (99-22) and broadway cards are playable
- ✅ Post-flop strength considers: pair strength, draws, and potential
- ✅ Function accounts for suited vs offsuit hands
- ✅ Unit tests cover 20+ hand combinations (48 tests covering 33+ combinations)

## Technical Highlights

### 1. Proper Rank Normalization
- Handles '10' vs 'T' representation differences between type system and pokersolver
- Robust rank comparison using numeric values

### 2. Post-flop Evaluation Logic
- **Monster hands:** Full House+, Four of a Kind, Straight Flush
- **Strong hands:** Three of a Kind, Straight, Flush
- **Medium hands:** Two Pair, Top Pair with good kicker (J+), Flush/Straight draws
- **Weak hands:** Top Pair with weak kicker, Middle/Bottom Pair, Overcards
- **Trash hands:** Complete air with no draws

### 3. Drawing Potential Detection
- Flush draw detection (4 cards of same suit)
- Straight draw detection (4 cards within 4-rank span)
- Overcard evaluation for bluffing potential

### 4. Pair Strength Evaluation
- Distinguishes between pocket pairs and made pairs
- Evaluates overpairs vs underpairs
- Considers kicker strength (Jack+ = good kicker)
- Compares pair rank to board texture

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { getHandTier, evaluatePostFlopStrength } from './utils/aiUtils';
import { Suit } from './types';

// Preflop evaluation
const hand1 = [
  { suit: Suit.Spades, rank: 'A' },
  { suit: Suit.Hearts, rank: 'K' }
];
console.log(getHandTier(hand1[0], hand1[1])); // 'strong'

// Post-flop evaluation
const holeCards = [
  { suit: Suit.Spades, rank: 'A' },
  { suit: Suit.Hearts, rank: 'K' }
];
const communityCards = [
  { suit: Suit.Diamonds, rank: 'K' },
  { suit: Suit.Clubs, rank: '8' },
  { suit: Suit.Hearts, rank: '3' }
];
console.log(evaluatePostFlopStrength(holeCards, communityCards)); // 'medium' (top pair, good kicker)
```

## Next Steps

This implementation provides the foundation for Task 2.2 (Position Awareness) and Task 2.3 (Preflop AI Decision Logic), where these hand evaluation functions will be used to make strategic AI decisions based on table position and betting action.
