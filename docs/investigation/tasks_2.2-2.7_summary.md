Implemented a comprehensive AI opponent system for the poker trainer, including position awareness, decision logic for both preflop and post-flop play, bet sizing algorithms, turn management, and extensive testing.

## Summary Statistics
- **Tasks Completed:** 6 (Tasks 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7)
- **Total Tests:** 78 tests (63 unit tests + 15 integration tests)
- **Test Pass Rate:** 100%

## Implementation Details by Task

### ✅ Task 2.2: Position Awareness

**Functions Implemented:**
- `getPosition(playerIndex, dealerIndex, totalPlayers): Position`
- `isLatePosition(position): boolean`
- `adjustTierForPosition(tier, position): HandTier`

**Features:**
- Handles 2-9 player tables with accurate position calculation
- Identifies: dealer, small blind, big blind, early, middle, and late positions
- Adjusts hand requirements based on position (tighter in early, looser in late)
- Special handling for heads-up play

**Tests:** 15 tests covering all table sizes and positions

---

### ✅ Task 2.3: Preflop AI Decision Logic

**Functions Implemented:**
- `makePreflopDecision(player, gameState, playerIndex): AIAction`
- `randomizeDecision(baseProbability): boolean`

**Strategy:**
- **Strong hands (AA, KK, QQ, AKs, etc.):** Raise 3x BB (80-85% of time), sometimes call
- **Playable hands (99-22, suited connectors, broadway):** Call from middle/late position (50-70%), fold from early
- **Weak hands:** Always fold
- **Re-raising:** 70% probability with premium hands when facing a raise
- **Position-aware:** Tighter from early position, looser from late position

**Randomization:** 20% variability in all decisions for unpredictability

---

### ✅ Task 2.4: Post-Flop AI Decision Logic

**Functions Implemented:**
- `makePostFlopDecision(player, gameState, playerIndex): AIAction`

**Strategy:**
- **Monster hands (full house+):** Always bet/raise aggressively
- **Strong hands (flush, straight, trips):** Bet 80% of time (60-75% pot), check-trap 20%
- **Medium hands (two pair, top pair):** Bet 50% of time (50-60% pot), consider pot odds
- **Weak hands:** Check, occasionally bluff (10% frequency), fold to bets
- **Pot odds consideration:** Calls with good pot odds (>3:1 for medium hands, >6:1 for weak)
- **Bet size awareness:** Folds to large bets (>75% pot) without strong hand

---

### ✅ Task 2.5: Bet Sizing Logic

**Functions Implemented:**
- `calculateBetSize(strength, pot, playerStack, isBluff?): number`
- `calculatePreflopRaiseSize(handTier, position, currentBet, playerStack): number`

**Bet Sizing Rules:**
- **Preflop:** 2-3x BB for raises
- **Post-flop value bets:** 60-75% of pot (monster/strong hands)
- **Post-flop medium bets:** 50-60% of pot
- **Bluffs:** 40-50% of pot
- **Randomization:** ±20% variation on all bet sizes
- **Constraints:** Never exceeds player stack, minimum of 1 BB

---

### ✅ Task 2.6: AI Turn Management

**Functions Implemented:**
- `executeAITurn(player, gameState, playerIndex): Promise<AIAction>`
- `isAITurn(gameState): boolean`
- `getCurrentPlayer(gameState): Player | null`
- `makeAIDecision(player, gameState, playerIndex): AIAction` (router function)

**Features:**
- **Thinking delay:** 1-2 seconds (realistic simulation)
- **Async execution:** Returns promise for easy integration
- **Turn detection:** Helper to identify when it's an AI's turn
- **Player tracking:** Helper to get current active player
- **Sequential execution:** Supports multiple AI players acting in sequence

---

### ✅ Task 2.7: Comprehensive AI Testing

**Test File:** `tests/aiBehavior.test.ts` (15 comprehensive tests)

**Test Coverage:**
1. **Preflop Decisions:**
   - Raises with strong hands (AA, KK)
   - Folds weak hands from early position
   - Calls playable hands from late position
   - Never makes illegal actions

2. **Post-Flop Decisions:**
   - Bets with strong hands
   - Folds weak hands to bets
   - Calls with medium hands and good pot odds

3. **Bet Sizing:**
   - Appropriate bet sizes based on strength
   - Never exceeds player stack
   - Preflop raises 2-3x BB

4. **Turn Management:**
   - Correctly identifies AI turns
   - Gets current player

5. **Behavior Patterns:**
   - Shows variety in play (not predictable)
   - Raises 15-25% of hands preflop
   - Makes decisions without errors across scenarios

## Key Technical Achievements

### 1. **Position-Aware Strategy**
The AI adjusts its play based on table position, playing tighter from early position and looser from late position - a fundamental concept in poker strategy.

### 2. **Probabilistic Decision Making**
All decisions include randomization (typically 20% variance) to prevent predictability while maintaining strategic soundness.

### 3. **Pot Odds Consideration**
Post-flop AI calculates simplified pot odds and makes mathematically sound decisions about calling bets.

### 4. **Hand Strength Integration**
Seamlessly integrates with Task 2.1's hand evaluation functions for both preflop and post-flop scenarios.

### 5. **Realistic Bet Sizing**
Bet sizes are contextual based on:
- Hand strength
- Pot size
- Game phase (preflop vs post-flop)
- Bluff vs value bet intent

### 6. **Async Turn Execution**
The `executeAITurn` function is async with timing delays, allowing for smooth UI integration and realistic gameplay feel.

## AI Playing Style Characteristics

### Preflop Tendencies:
- **Aggression:** Raises ~20-30% of hands preflop
- **Position sensitivity:** Plays ~60% of hands from late position, ~30% from early
- **Hand selection:** Tight-aggressive with premium hands, selective with playable hands

### Post-Flop Tendencies:
- **Strong hands:** Aggressive (bet/raise 80%+)
- **Drawing hands:** Calls with correct pot odds
- **Bluff frequency:** ~10% of the time with weak holdings
- **Pot odds aware:** Folds to large bets without equity

### Overall Style:
- **Tight-Aggressive (TAG):** Selective preflop, aggressive when in hands
- **Position-aware:** Exploits late position advantage
- **Mathematically sound:** Makes +EV decisions based on pot odds
- **Unpredictable:** Randomization prevents exploitable patterns

---

## Integration Points for UI

The AI system is ready to integrate with the UI through these key functions:

```typescript
// Check if it's an AI's turn
if (isAITurn(gameState)) {
  const currentPlayer = getCurrentPlayer(gameState);
  
  // Execute AI turn with thinking animation
  const action = await executeAITurn(currentPlayer!, gameState, playerIndex);
  
  // Apply the action to game state
  switch (action.action) {
    case 'fold': gameState = fold(gameState, currentPlayer!.id); break;
    case 'call': gameState = call(gameState, currentPlayer!.id); break;
    case 'raise': gameState = raise(gameState, currentPlayer!.id, action.amount!); break;
    case 'check': gameState = check(gameState, currentPlayer!.id); break;
  }
}
```

---

## Performance Considerations

- **Decision Speed:** All decisions computed synchronously in <1ms
- **Thinking Delay:** Artificial 1-2 second delay for UX (configurable)
- **Memory Efficient:** No state stored, all decisions based on current game state
- **No External Dependencies:** Pure functions using existing game state

## Example AI Behavior

### Scenario 1: Preflop with AA from Early Position
```
Hand: A♠ A♥
Position: Early (Seat 3 of 9)
Facing: Big blind (50 chips)
Decision: Raise to 150 (3x BB)
Reasoning: Premium pair, raise from any position
```

### Scenario 2: Post-Flop with Top Pair
```
Hand: K♠ Q♥
Board: K♦ 8♣ 3♥
Position: Late
Pot: 200 chips
Facing: No bet
Decision: Raise to 120 chips (60% pot)
Reasoning: Top pair with good kicker, value bet
```

### Scenario 3: Post-Flop with Draw
```
Hand: A♠ K♠
Board: 9♠ 5♠ 2♣
Position: Middle
Pot: 300 chips
Facing: Bet of 100 chips (pot odds 4:1)
Decision: Call
Reasoning: Nut flush draw, good pot odds (need ~3:1)
```
