  if (shouldTriggerAutoCoaching(gameState, hasReceivedCoaching)) {
    requestAutoCoaching(gameState, onAdviceReceived, onError);
  }
}, [gameState]);

  requestAdvice,
  sendMessage,
  requestFeedback
} = useCoaching(gameState, {
  autoCoachingEnabled: true,
  feedbackEnabled: false
});
```

---

## Usage Example

### Basic Integration

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { useCoaching } from './hooks/useCoaching';
import { isUserTurn } from './utils/coachingUtils';
import AIAssistant from './components/AIAssistant';

function PokerGame() {
  const gameState = useGameStore();
  
  const {
    messages,
    isLoading,
    isAutoAdviceLoading,
    latestAdvice,
    requestAdvice,
    sendMessage
  } = useCoaching(gameState, {
    autoCoachingEnabled: true,
    feedbackEnabled: false
  });

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Game components */}
      
      <AIAssistant
        messages={messages}
        isLoading={isLoading}
        isAutoAdviceLoading={isAutoAdviceLoading}
        latestAdvice={latestAdvice}
        isUserTurn={isUserTurn(gameState)}
        onGetAdvice={requestAdvice}
        onSendMessage={sendMessage}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## API Integration

### Gemini API Configuration

The implementation uses **Gemini 2.0 Flash** model for optimal performance:

```typescript
const ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: process.env.API_KEY });

const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
  model: 'gemini-2.0-flash-exp',
  contents: prompt,
});
```

### Environment Variables Required

```bash
# .env file
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
