# ICP Cycles Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented ICP cycles economy system for the poker trainer application. Users now have a cycles balance that decrements with each hand played, with a clear display of remaining cycles and hands.

## Files Created

### 1. `/docs/ICP_CYCLES_ECONOMY.md`
Comprehensive documentation covering:
- ICP to cycles conversion rates
- Game economy (1 trillion cycles = 100 hands)
- Cost per hand (10 billion cycles)
- UI display specifications
- Technical implementation details
- Future enhancements
- Exchange rate sources and update frequency

### 2. `/src/utils/cyclesUtils.ts`
Utility functions for cycles management:
- **Constants**:
  - `CYCLES_PER_HAND = 10_000_000_000` (10 billion)
  - `HANDS_PER_TRILLION = 100`
  - `CYCLES_PER_TRILLION = 1_000_000_000_000`
  - `STARTING_CYCLES_BALANCE = 10_000_000_000_000` (10 trillion = 1,000 hands)

- **Functions**:
  - `cyclesToHands(cycles)` - Convert cycles to available hands
  - `handsToCycles(hands)` - Convert hands to cycles cost
  - `formatCycles(cycles)` - Format for display (e.g., "5.2T", "750B")
  - `deductHandCost(balance)` - Deduct cost of one hand
  - `canPlayHand(balance)` - Check if user can play
  - `costPerHandUSD(xdrRate)` - Calculate USD cost per hand
  - `usdToCycles(usd, xdrRate)` - Convert USD to cycles
  - `cyclesToUSD(cycles, xdrRate)` - Convert cycles to USD

## Files Modified

### 1. `/src/types/index.ts`
Added to `GameState` interface:
```typescript
/** The user's remaining ICP cycles balance. */
cyclesBalance: number;
/** The number of hands completed in the current session. */
handsCompleted: number;
```

### 2. `/src/store/gameStore.ts`
**Imports Added:**
```typescript
import { STARTING_CYCLES_BALANCE, deductHandCost } from '../utils/cyclesUtils';
```

**Initial State:**
```typescript
cyclesBalance: STARTING_CYCLES_BALANCE, // 10 trillion cycles (1,000 hands)
handsCompleted: 0,
```

**Modified `startNewHand()` Action:**
- Deducts 10 billion cycles per hand (except first hand)
- Increments `handsCompleted` counter
- Updates state with new cycles balance

```typescript
// Deduct cycles for this hand (except for the very first hand)
const newCyclesBalance = currentState.handsCompleted > 0 
  ? deductHandCost(currentState.cyclesBalance)
  : currentState.cyclesBalance;
const newHandsCompleted = currentState.handsCompleted + 1;
```

### 3. `/src/components/GameInfoPanel.tsx`
**Imports Added:**
```typescript
import { cyclesToHands, formatCycles } from '../utils/cyclesUtils';
```

**Added to Component State:**
```typescript
const handsLeft = cyclesToHands(cyclesBalance);
const formattedCycles = formatCycles(cyclesBalance);
```

**New UI Sections:**
1. **Cycles Balance Display**:
   - Label: "Cycles"
   - Shows formatted cycles (e.g., "10.0T", "9.9T")
   - White text, bold

2. **Hands Left Display**:
   - Label: "Hands Left"
   - Shows number of hands remaining
   - Red text when < 10 hands (warning)
   - White text otherwise

## UI Changes

### GameInfoPanel Layout
The info panel now displays (left to right):
1. **Current Pot** - Main pot and side pots
2. **Game Phase** - Current phase of the hand
3. **Your Hand** - Hand strength/cards
4. **Cycles** - Remaining cycles balance (NEW)
5. **Hands Left** - Number of hands available (NEW)
6. **Last Winner** - Previous hand winner (if applicable)

### Visual Indicators
- **Low Balance Warning**: Hands left turns red when < 10 hands
- **Formatted Display**: Cycles shown as "10.0T" for readability
- **Real-time Updates**: Decrements after each hand completion

## Economy Details

### Starting Balance
- **10 trillion cycles** (10,000,000,000,000)
- Equivalent to **1,000 hands** of gameplay
- Approximately **$13.55 USD** worth (at 1 XDR = $1.354820)

### Cost Per Hand
- **10 billion cycles** (10,000,000,000)
- Approximately **$0.0135 USD** per hand

### Deduction Logic
1. Hand starts
2. If not first hand, deduct 10 billion cycles
3. Update cycles balance
4. Recalculate hands left
5. Display updates in real-time

## Future Implementation (Planned)

### When Hands Left Reaches 0
The following logic will be implemented:
1. Disable all action buttons (fold, call, raise)
2. Show "Out of Cycles" modal/overlay
3. Display options:
   - "Add Cycles" button → ICP wallet integration
   - Show cost breakdown (e.g., "$10 = 737.5B cycles = 73 hands")
   - "Purchase" flow with ICP payment
4. Prevent starting new hands until cycles added

### Additional Features
- **Cycles Purchase Flow**: Integration with ICP wallet
- **Subscription Model**: Monthly packages at discounted rates
- **Bonus Cycles**: Rewards for active players
- **Tournament Mode**: Special cycle rates
- **Referral System**: Earn cycles by referring players
- **Analytics**: Track spending patterns and optimize pricing

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. Start new game - verify 10T cycles, 1000 hands
2. Play first hand - verify no deduction
3. Complete first hand - verify 10B deducted, 999 hands left
4. Play multiple hands - verify consistent deduction
5. Check display formatting at various balances:
   - > 1T: Shows as "X.XT"
   - < 1T, > 1B: Shows as "X.XB"
   - < 100 hands: Verify red text warning

### Unit Tests (To Be Created)
```typescript
// Test cycles utilities
describe('cyclesUtils', () => {
  test('cyclesToHands calculation', () => {
    expect(cyclesToHands(10_000_000_000_000)).toBe(1000);
    expect(cyclesToHands(100_000_000_000)).toBe(10);
  });
  
  test('formatCycles display', () => {
    expect(formatCycles(10_000_000_000_000)).toBe('10.0T');
    expect(formatCycles(500_000_000_000)).toBe('500.0B');
  });
  
  test('deductHandCost', () => {
    expect(deductHandCost(10_000_000_000_000)).toBe(9_990_000_000_000);
    expect(deductHandCost(5_000_000_000)).toBe(0); // Can't go negative
  });
});
```

## Exchange Rate Updates

### Current Rates (October 25, 2025)
- 1 XDR = $1.354820 USD
- 1 ICP = $3.14 USD
- $1 USD = 737.5 billion cycles

### Update Sources
- **XDR/USD**: [IMF Official Data](https://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/data/rms_sdrv.aspx)
- **ICP/USD**: [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/internet-computer/)

### Update Schedule
- XDR rates: Daily
- ICP price: Real-time
- Game pricing: Monthly review

## Success Metrics

### Implementation Complete ✅
- [x] Created cycles utility functions
- [x] Added cycles tracking to GameState
- [x] Integrated deduction logic in startNewHand
- [x] Updated UI to display cycles and hands left
- [x] Added low balance warning (red text < 10 hands)
- [x] Created comprehensive documentation

### Pending (Future Phases)
- [ ] Zero balance handling (disable gameplay)
- [ ] ICP wallet integration
- [ ] Cycles purchase flow
- [ ] Analytics tracking
- [ ] Unit tests for cycles utilities
- [ ] Integration tests for deduction logic

## Notes

- First hand is free (no deduction) to allow users to start playing immediately
- Cycles balance persists in game state but not localStorage (resets on refresh)
- Future: Implement localStorage or backend persistence for cycles balance
- Future: Add "Add Cycles" button in UI when balance is low
- All cycle calculations use integer math to avoid floating-point precision issues
